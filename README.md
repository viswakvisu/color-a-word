# color-a-word

As per the requirement, I developed this app.

However because of security reasons (for API authentication details), I deployed node proxy server as well in Heroku to handle API actions with `https://www.pexels.com/`.

To know about helper libraries used in this app, please have a look at `package.json` file.

Please follow below steps to run the app in local environment.
  1) Clone the repo.
  2) Run `npm i` command to install all modules.
  3) Run `npm run dev` command to start the application.
  
  Other option:
    If you don't want to install modules in your local, then please make use of files (prebundled one) inside `dist` folder.
